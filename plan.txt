1. Let's build the model to recognise the sentiment/intent of the text that user asks.
    - for these let's collect all possible questions those serve perticular intention.
    for example
      let's say, have 10 kinds of responses such as
         response for greetings, goodbye, fee_structure, campus_placement, departments, adress,
                    extra curriculam activities, gratitude, commute/travel
        1. As we classify the input text as one of these categories. ask the confirmation question. 
            if user says yes, give corresponding response. If no, display all possible dropdown to select
        2. Once they select an option, give the final answer.
    
2. To achieve this,
    1. I might need tensorflow to train the model to classify the intent of the user input.
    If possible I could simply go for simple tf-idf representaiton and do the classification, no need to
    go for sequence model.
    2. build it separately in jupyter notebook and write the model to serparate folder and load it in this
        project folder
    3. before predicting the intent of the user let's do the preprocessing to,
        1. get rid of punctuations, urls, numbers, signs, stop_words and etc.
        2. bring entire text to lower case
        3. do stemming to bring all words to their base form
        4. refer vocabulary to replace the unkown word
        5. send this sequence of cleaned words to model to predict the intent of the text
        6. Once the intent is clear to the bot, we know the story as mentioned above.
